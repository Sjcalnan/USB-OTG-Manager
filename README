USB OTG Manager

This software is originally designed for Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc S.
Since OTG is enabled in kernel, I'm wondering why I can't access my memory
stick. So I've created this little application for reading books on my thumb
disk, and happily ever after ! :D

Supported Phone:
* Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc S (4.0.2.A.042, 4.0.2.A.062)
* Sony Ericsson Xperia Mini Pro (4.0.2.A.042, 4.0.2.A.058)
* Samsung Galaxy Nexus

Supported USB Device:
* FAT USB memory stick
* Card Reader

Just for fun, any questions feel free contact me :-)

About compiling kernel
1. Got tar ball from here [http://developer.sonyericsson.com/wportal/devworld/search-downloads/opensource]
   I use 4.0.2.A.0.61_62.tar.bz2
2. set environment
   export ARCH=arm
   export CROSS_COMPILE=$(somewhere)/prebuilt/linux-x86/toolchain/arm-eabi-4.4.0/bin/arm-eabi-
3. compile
   edit arch/arm/configs/semc_anzu_defconfig (arc s), set CONFIG_USB_STORAGE=m
   make semc_anzu_defconfig; echo -perf > .scmversion; make -j8
4. drivers/usb/storage/usb-storage.ko
