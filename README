USB OTG Manager

This software is designed for Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc S.
Since OTG is enabled in kernel, I'm wondering why I can't access my memory
stick. So I've created this little application for reading books on my thumb
disk, and happily ever after ! :D

* Support FAT USB memory stick
* Support Card Reader

Just for fun, any questions feel free contact me :-)
