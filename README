USB OTG Manager

This software is originally designed for Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc S.
Since OTG is enabled in kernel, I'm wondering why I can't access my memory
stick. So I've created this little application for reading books on my thumb
disk, and happily ever after ! :D

Supported Phone:
* Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc S (4.0.2.A.042, 4.0.2.A.062)
* Sony Ericsson Xperia Mini Pro (4.0.2.A.042, 4.0.2.A.058)
* Samsung Galaxy Nexus

Supported USB Device:
* FAT USB memory stick
* Card Reader

Just for fun, any questions feel free contact me :-)
